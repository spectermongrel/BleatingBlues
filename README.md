the site for this is https://bleatingblues.replit.app/, the sheep's name is lucile ... for some reason it lacks the audio that i put in there initially, but i dont really wanna change it.
the song is "look your back!" by himiko kikuchi. though the song doesnt really match the theme of the minigame, i feel like it deserved to be put in there.
while making this game and all my other mini projects, i had the album "flying beagle" on repeat. it was a good timer for when i worked!
not that this album was a direct source of inspiration, but it does serve as a very happy memory when i listen to the album. i had a lot of fun during the coding program i took.
i still dont understand how exactly to use github, but im getting there. i hope dearly that in the future (no matter how long), ill be able to flesh out this game better to see my progress.
:)
until that happens, ill be a flying beagle!
